# 08 — Retro

## Goal

Convert the experience into a reusable mental model.

## Retro prompts

Answer in writing (short bullets are fine):

1. Where did the loop feel smooth?
2. Where did the loop feel brittle?
3. What was the biggest source of ambiguity?
4. What was the strongest deterministic gate?
5. What was the strongest probabilistic gate?
6. What would you automate next?

## “Inner loop” checklist you can reuse

When you start a new project:

- [ ] Define an output contract (schema, interface, invariants)
- [ ] Write a short spec and keep it updated
- [ ] Write a plan that decomposes into 0.5–2 hour tasks
- [ ] Store tasks as GitHub Issues (durable memory)
- [ ] Keep deterministic gates always green (tests)
- [ ] Evaluate probabilistic quality with a dataset + tracked versions
- [ ] Turn evaluation into new issues and update the spec

## Optional: expand the loop

If you want to go further, add:

- automated label syncing
- more diverse datasets
- prompt regression tests
- structured “model cards” per version

## End

You have completed at least one full inner loop.
Run it again on a different repo to make it muscle memory.
