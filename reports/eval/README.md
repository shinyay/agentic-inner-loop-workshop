# Evaluation reports

Put evaluation notes here.

Why this exists:

- AI Toolkit evaluation results are great in the UI, but workshop learning improves when you
  *write down what changed* and *what to do next*.
- The inner loop only closes when evaluation findings become **actionable tasks**.

Suggested naming:

- `YYYYMMDD_HHMM_baseline.md`
- `YYYYMMDD_HHMM_prompt-v2.md`

Template:

- See `docs/templates/eval-report.template.md`
